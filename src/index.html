                    <h2>Book 2</h2>
                    <h3>Section 1</h3>
                    <p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling,
                        ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell
                        good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have
                        recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but
                        the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.</p>
                    <p>So none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my
                        relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two
                        rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone,
                        to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.</p>
                    <h3>Section 5</h3>
                    <p>Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what's in front of you with precise and
                        genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other
                        distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in
                        your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you,
                        stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable.</p>
                    <p>You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage
                        this, that's all even the gods can asof you.</p>

                    <h2>Third chapter here.</h2>

                    <p>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work—as a
                        human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for—the things I
                        was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the
                        blankets and stay warm?"</p>

                    <p>—But it's nicer here...</p>

                    <p>So you were born to feel "nice"? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don't you see the
                        plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the
                        world in order, as best they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why
                        aren't you running to do what your nature demands?</p>

                    <p>—But we have to sleep sometime...</p>

                    <p>Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you're over the
                        limit. You've had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you're still below your
                        quota.</p>

                    <p>You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People
                        who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you
                        have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the
                        dance, the miser for money, or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by
                        what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.</p>

                    <p>Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?</p>
